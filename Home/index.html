            <h2>Aquí algunas cosas sobre Café</h2>
            <p> You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed
                the world once and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took us a week to climb out. Now,
                I don't know exactly when we turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived the slide...
                and only five made it out. Now we took an oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the
                snow that killed the other two, but it wasn't. Nature is lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to man.

                Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That show's called a pilot. Then they show
                that show to the people who make shows, and on the strength of that one show they decide if they're
                going to make more shows. Some pilots get picked and become television programs. Some don't, become
                nothing. She starred in one of the ones that became nothing.

                Do you see any Teletubbies in here? Do you see a slender plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my
                name printed on it? Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression on his face sitting
                outside on a mechanical helicopter that shakes when you put quarters in it? No? Well, that's what
                you see at a toy store. And you must think you're in a toy store, because you're here shopping for
                an infant named Jeb.


            <p>Your bones don't break, mine do. That's clear. Your cells react to bacteria and viruses differently than
                mine. You don't get sick, I do. That's also clear. But for some reason, you and I react the exact same
                way to water. We swallow it too fast, we choke. We get some in our lungs, we drown. However unreal it
                may seem, we are connected, you and I. We're on the same curve, just on opposite ends. </p>

            <p>My money's in that office, right? If she start giving me some bullshit about it ain't there, and we got
                to go someplace else and get it, I'm gonna shoot you in the head then and there. Then I'm gonna shoot
                that bitch in the kneecaps, find out where my goddamn money is. She gonna tell me too. Hey, look at me
                when I'm talking to you, motherfucker. You listen: we go in there, and that nigga Winston or anybody
                else is in there, you the first motherfucker to get shot. You understand? </p>

            <p>Now that there is the Tec-9, a crappy spray gun from South Miami. This gun is advertised as the most
                popular gun in American crime. Do you believe that shit? It actually says that in the little book that
                comes with it: the most popular gun in American crime. Like they're actually proud of that shit. </p>
